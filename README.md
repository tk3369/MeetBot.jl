# MeetBot

A Discord bot that brings people together.

## How it works

1. Type `meet` command to register for meeting people
2. When 4 people are registered, a voice channel is created and the people will receive a DM with a link to the channel.
3. People click to join the voice channel. Introduce to each other & chat for a while.
4. Voice channel is automatically deleted after some time e.g. 2 hours.
